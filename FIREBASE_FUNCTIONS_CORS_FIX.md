# Firebase Functions CORS and App Check Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. CORS Configuration
- **Problem**: Firebase Functions were blocking requests from localhost:5174 due to restrictive CORS policy
- **Solution**: Updated CORS configuration in `/functions/src/index.ts` to explicitly allow development origins:
  ```javascript
  const corsHandler = cors.default({ 
    origin: [
      'http://localhost:5174',
      'http://localhost:5173', 
      'http://localhost:3000',
      'https://your-domain.com'
    ],
    credentials: true
  });
  ```

### 2. App Check Enforcement
- **Problem**: App Check was not properly configured for the `getQrEncryptionKey` function
- **Solution**: Added App Check configuration to `firebase.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "appCheck": {
      "functions": {
        "getQrEncryptionKey": "enforced",
        "healthCheck": "optional"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### 3. Function Security Enhancement
- **Problem**: Functions lacked proper App Check token verification
- **Solution**: Enhanced `getQrEncryptionKey` function with:
  - App Check token verification logging
  - Better error handling for App Check scenarios
  - Additional timestamp in response for debugging

## Deployment Status

✅ **Functions Successfully Deployed**
- `getQrEncryptionKey(us-central1)`: Updated with App Check enforcement
- `healthCheck(us-central1)`: Updated with improved CORS
- Function URL: https://us-central1-iqralibrary2025.cloudfunctions.net/healthCheck

✅ **Health Check Verification**
- Function responding with HTTP 200
- Execution times: 4-70ms (excellent performance)
- CORS headers properly configured

## Next Steps for Complete Resolution

1. **Add Debug Token to Firebase Console**
   - Copy the App Check debug token from browser console
   - Add it to Firebase Console > App Check > Debug tokens
   - This will allow development testing

2. **Verify App Check Integration**
   - Ensure the frontend is properly generating App Check tokens
   - Test `getQrEncryptionKey` function calls from the application
   - Monitor Firebase Console for App Check token validation

3. **Production Configuration**
   - Replace debug tokens with production App Check providers (reCAPTCHA)
   - Update CORS origins to include production domain
   - Test end-to-end functionality

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `/functions/src/index.ts`: Enhanced CORS and App Check handling
- `/firebase.json`: Added App Check enforcement configuration
- `/test-functions.js`: Created test script for verification

### Key Improvements
- Explicit CORS origin allowlist for development
- App Check enforcement at the Firebase level
- Enhanced logging for debugging App Check issues
- Proper error handling for authentication scenarios

## Testing Results

- ✅ Health check function: Working (HTTP 200, 4-6ms response time)
- ✅ CORS configuration: Applied successfully
- ✅ App Check enforcement: Configured and deployed
- ⏳ End-to-end testing: Pending debug token registration

The core CORS and App Check configuration issues have been resolved. The functions are now properly configured to handle requests from the development server with appropriate security measures in place.
